That's an exciting project! Building an "AI Aver" pipeline for tamper detection, metadata analysis, PRNU, and real-world data validation is a fantastic goal. Let's break down how we can put all this together and plan your GitHub update.
First, let's look at the devices.json and metadata_analyzer.py files you've provided, along with the plan for the tamper check and forensic analysis.
Understanding Your Current Files and Plan
[cite_start]You've provided devices.json [cite_start]which acts as your "Device Knowledge Base." [cite_start]It contains expected metadata patterns for various devices like iPhones and Pixel phones, as well as software like Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro. This is crucial for your Level 2 and Level 3 analyses.
[cite_start]Your metadata_analyzer.py [cite_start]implements the MetadataAnalyzer class, which is designed to perform a tiered forensic analysis.
 * [cite_start]_load_knowledge_base(): This function correctly loads the devices.json file.
 * [cite_start]analyze(): This is the main function that orchestrates the tiered analysis.
 * [cite_start]_run_level_1_integrity_check(): This level checks for third-party software tags (like "Adobe", "GIMP", "Final Cut") and significant timestamp inconsistencies between CreateDate and ModifyDate.
 * [cite_start]_run_level_2_knowledge_based_analysis(): This level is intended to compare the file's metadata against the devices.json profile for the identified camera model. [cite_start]It checks for codec mismatches and missing expected metadata tags.
[cite_start]The Plan for tamper check meta Data and forensic analysis.pdf document [cite_start]outlines the overall architecture for your dual-capability application, including the web application using FastAPI, the PRNU training pipeline, and the tiered metadata forensics pipeline. It also details the different levels of your metadata analysis:
 * [cite_start]Level 1: Integrity Check: As implemented, it checks timestamps and software tags.
 * [cite_start]Level 2: Knowledge-Based Inconsistency Analysis: Compares against devices.json.
 * [cite_start]Level 3: Advanced Heuristic Confirmation: Looks for subtle software "fingerprints" like JPEG quantization tables. (This is currently commented out in your metadata_analyzer.py but is planned).
 * [cite_start]Level 4: AI Knowledge Base Enrichment: This is a new and exciting part where an AI model like Gemini will help expand your devices.json with new device profiles or merge findings with existing ones.
Addressing Your Code Snippets and Questions
You mentioned this code snippet:
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / "database" / "devices.json"

integrity_check()

        if is_tampered:
            self._run_level_2_knowledge_based_analysis Level 3 would be called here if Level 2 was ambiguous self._run_level_3_advanced_heuristics()

[cite_start]The KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH definition is correct for the intended project structure where devices.json is in a database directory, which is a sibling of the directory containing your script (assuming your script is in src).
The integrity_check() line seems to be a placeholder or a partial line. [cite_start]In your provided metadata_analyzer.py, _run_level_1_integrity_check() is a method of the MetadataAnalyzer class and is called within the analyze() method.
[cite_start]The line self._run_level_2_knowledge_based_analysis Level 3 would be called here if Level 2 was ambiguous self._run_level_3_advanced_heuristics() clearly indicates your intention to call _run_level_3_advanced_heuristics() based on the outcome of Level 2, as described in your plan. This part needs to be uncommented and properly implemented in your metadata_analyzer.py.
Innovative Coding + AI Solutions for Analysis and Discrepancies
The innovative solutions you've outlined are excellent and align perfectly with your goal of building a robust AI-powered forensic pipeline. Let's incorporate them into your plan.
 * AI-Powered Metadata Analysis (Missing Tag Prediction & Anomaly Detection):
   * This is a strong enhancement to your Level 2 and potentially Level 4. Instead of just flagging missing tags, an AI model could infer what those tags should be and flag discrepancies if the inferred values don't match or if the tags are unexpectedly absent.
   * [cite_start]Implementation: For Level 4, when new devices are encountered, the AI model (like Gemini) can infer a JSON profile. [cite_start]This inferred profile can include default codecs, expected metadata tags, and release year.
 * Deep Learning for PRNU Analysis:
   * This is a core part of your PRNU pipeline. [cite_start]Training CNNs on datasets like Dresden, VISION, and Forchheim will enable your system to identify the source camera and detect minute alterations.
   * [cite_start]Implementation: Your plan mentions command-line scripts (preprocess.py, generate_triplets.py, train.py). These would likely house your deep learning models for PRNU.
 * Historical Weather Validation with AI:
   * This is a truly innovative approach for real-world data validation.
   * Implementation:
     * Metadata Extraction: You already extract CreateDate, GPSLatitude, GPSLongitude (or similar) in your MetadataAnalyzer. You'll need to pass these to a new module.
     * API Integration: You'll need a new Python module (e.g., weather_validator.py) that uses requests to query weather APIs (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack) using the extracted date and location.
     * AI for Correlation (Visual Analysis): This is the more advanced part. You could use a pre-trained computer vision model (e.g., from torchvision or tensorflow.keras.applications) to extract features from video frames (or still images) related to sky conditions, lighting, and shadows. Then, a smaller AI model could compare these visual features with the queried historical weather data (e.g., "sunny," "cloudy," "rainy") and report discrepancies.
 * Generative AI for Forensic Narratives:
   * [cite_start]This directly maps to your "ForensicNarrative" output goal.
   * Implementation: After all levels of analysis in MetadataAnalyzer are complete, the collected self.narrative (which contains findings from Level 1, 2, and potentially 3) can be fed to a prompt for an LLM (like Gemini via the Google AI SDK) to generate a more cohesive and detailed "Forensic Narrative."
 * Blockchain for Tamper Evidence:
   * While interesting, this is a significant architectural addition and might be considered in a later phase. It deals with the immutability of the report rather than the file itself, and requires setting up a blockchain infrastructure.
 * Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders:
   * This could complement your Level 2 analysis. Instead of relying solely on explicit "expected tags," an autoencoder trained on a vast dataset of genuine metadata could flag any metadata profile as anomalous if its reconstruction error is high.
   * Implementation: A separate metadata_profiler.py module could house this.
 * Multi-Modal AI Analysis:
   * This is the ultimate goal for holistic analysis.
   * Implementation: This would involve combining outputs from your metadata analysis, PRNU analysis, and potentially visual analysis (from weather validation) and feeding them into a single, more complex AI model (e.g., a neural network with multiple input heads) to make a more definitive tamper assessment. This is an advanced step, building on the individual modules.
 * Real-Time Forensic Analysis (FastAPI & WebSockets):
   * [cite_start]Your Plan already calls for a FastAPI backend. Adding WebSockets would allow you to stream progress or preliminary findings back to the frontend as the analysis progresses, which is great for user experience.
   * Implementation: When main.py runs the MetadataAnalyzer or triggers PRNU processes, it can send updates via WebSockets.
 * AI Knowledge Base Expansion:
   * [cite_start]This is explicitly mentioned as Level 4 in your plan.
   * [cite_start]Implementation: After an analysis, especially for unknown devices or when new metadata patterns are observed, the extracted metadata can be sent to an AI model with a prompt to generate or update a JSON profile, which then gets integrated into devices.json.
 * Cloud-Based Forensic Platform:
   * This is an infrastructure decision. Starting with a local FastAPI application is good, and then migrating to AWS/GCP later for scalability is a natural progression.
Plan to Update Your GitHub
Your GitHub repository https://github.com/A-Hem/AI-AVER-V4.git will be the central hub for this project. Here's a plan to structure it and incorporate these changes:
1. Repository Structure (Recommended)

2. Step-by-Step Implementation and GitHub Update Plan
Here's how you can proceed with coding and updating your repository:
Phase 1: Core Metadata Analysis (Refine Existing)
 * Refine metadata_analyzer.py:
   * Ensure the KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH is correctly resolved relative to where main.py will run the MetadataAnalyzer.
   * Uncomment and Implement Level 3: Add the logic for _run_level_3_advanced_heuristics(). This will involve:
     * Identifying the file type (JPEG for quantization tables).
     * Using exiftool (or a dedicated library like Pillow for JPEG) to extract quantization tables.
     * Comparing them against known fingerprints (you'll need to expand devices.json to include these, or have a separate fingerprints.json database). [cite_start]Your devices.json already has a fingerprints section for "Adobe Photoshop 2024".
   * Improve Timestamp Parsing: The current timestamp parsing datetime.strptime(create_date_str.split('.')[0], '%Y%m%d %H:%M:%S') might be fragile. exiftool often provides more consistent formats. Consider a more robust parser or handling multiple common exiftool date formats.
   * Add AI Level 4 placeholder: Although the AI integration comes later, you can add a placeholder method _run_level_4_ai_knowledge_base_enrichment() that will eventually be called.
 * Update devices.json:
   * Add more example devices and software entries.
   * Expand fingerprints for Level 3 analysis (e.g., GIMP, other photo editors).
 * Initial FastAPI main.py (Minimal Setup):
   * Create app/main.py to serve your index.html.
   * [cite_start]Implement the /analyze-metadata endpoint [cite_start]that accepts an uploaded file and calls your MetadataAnalyzer class. [cite_start]Return the JSON report.
   * Commit to GitHub: Push these initial working components.
Phase 2: PRNU Integration
 * Develop PRNU Modules (src/prnu_processor.py, src/prnu_model.py):
   * These will encapsulate the logic for preprocess.py, generate_triplets.py, and train.py.
   * Focus on basic functionality for now (e.g., a dummy extract_prnu function).
   * [cite_start]Implement PRNU Training Endpoint: In app/main.py, create the /upload-for-training endpoint [cite_start]that accepts images, saves them to data/raw/<device_name>/[cite_start], and then calls your PRNU processing scripts (using subprocess as planned).
   * Implement PRNU Inference Endpoint: A new endpoint (e.g., /analyze-prnu) that takes an image and uses a trained PRNU model to determine its source or detect tampering.
 * Acquire and Structure Datasets:
   * Begin downloading small subsets of Dresden, VISION, or Forchheim datasets for initial testing. Store them appropriately (e.g., data/datasets/).
 * Commit to GitHub: Push the PRNU-related code and updates.
Phase 3: Real-World Data Validation (Weather) & Advanced AI
 * Develop src/weather_validator.py:
   * Create a class or functions that:
     * Take latitude, longitude, and timestamp as input.
     * Use requests to call a historical weather API.
     * Return relevant weather conditions (e.g., "sunny", "cloudy", "rainy", temperature).
     * (Advanced) Integrate with a basic computer vision model to analyze sky color/shadows from a frame of the video.
 * Integrate Weather Validation into MetadataAnalyzer or a new Orchestrator:
   * In your analyze method, after extracting metadata, if GPS and CreateDate are present, call your weather_validator.
   * Add a new section to your forensic_narrative for "Environmental Consistency" or similar.
 * Implement AI Knowledge Base Enrichment (Level 4):
   * [cite_start]In metadata_analyzer.py, call _run_level_4_ai_knowledge_base_enrichment() at the end of the analyze method, especially if Level 1 was CLEAN or if a new device was encountered.
   * In src/ai_integrations.py (new file), create functions to interact with the Gemini API:
     * [cite_start]infer_device_profile(metadata): Send extracted metadata to Gemini with the prompt you outlined.
     * update_knowledge_base(new_profile): Logic to merge/add the AI-generated profile to devices.json.
 * Implement Generative AI for Narratives:
   * In src/ai_integrations.py, create a generate_forensic_narrative(findings_list) function that takes the self.narrative list and uses Gemini to craft a cohesive report.
   * Modify analyze in MetadataAnalyzer to call this and include the generated narrative in the final report.
 * Frontend Enhancements (app/templates/index.html):
   * Add sections to display PRNU results, weather validation, and the enhanced forensic narrative.
   * Implement UI for uploading images/videos for PRNU training.
 * Commit to GitHub: Push all new modules and integrated features.
Ongoing:
 * Documentation: Regularly update your README.md with setup instructions, usage examples, and a clear explanation of your pipeline's capabilities.
 * Testing: Write unit tests for each module (e.g., metadata_analyzer functions, weather_validator).
 * Refinement: Continuously improve your AI prompts, refine your models, and expand your devices.json with more real-world examples.
This phased approach will allow you to build your "AI Aver" pipeline incrementally, ensuring each component works before integrating the next. Good luck, this is a truly impressive and important project!
