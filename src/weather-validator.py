# Weather API Integration (src/weather_validator.py): 
Code to connect to a historical weather API
 (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack). 
This module will need to take GPS coordinates 
and a timestamp, query the API, and return 
weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, temperature).
 * Visual-Weather Correlation
 (Advanced AI): Logic (potentially within src/weather_validator.py 
or src/ai_integrations.py) to extract visual 
features from the image/video
 (e.g., sky color, presence of shadows) 
and programmatically compare them against 
the historical weather data. 
This is an advanced AI task.
